# Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest Regression

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting gold prices using Random Forest Regression. The dataset used for training the model was obtained from Kaggle.

## Project Overview
Gold price prediction is a crucial task for investors and traders in the financial market. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to forecast the future prices of gold based on historical data and relevant features.

## Methodology
Random Forest Regression, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm, was employed to develop the predictive model. Random Forest combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and handle complex datasets.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of historical gold prices and associated features. The data was sourced from Kaggle and contains attributes such as date, opening price, closing price, high and low prices, trading volume, etc.
